# Jruby builds with Gradle
## A simple example

This repo is just a demonstration how gradle can be set up to compile jruby code into java classes.

Java code can then depend on that jruby code directly, with proper typing etc.

`app/build.gradle` has the relevant setup and logic. 

## How to

`gradle build run` to build and run the project.
